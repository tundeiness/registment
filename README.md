```

Run the project on your local server

```

Now you can navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:3001](http://127.0.0.1:3001)
inside [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and enjoy all the end-points

### Testing

- RSpec
- Factory Bot

Run the test in a local server:

```sh
  bundle exec rails spec
```

### Usage

This project is designed for only authorised users, and to run the project, you have to first do the following:

Open [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and register a new user;

Examples:

- Register a new user
  Request : `POST`
  URL : `http://127.0.0.1:3001/users`
  Body :
  ```json
    {
        "user": {
        "first_name":"Kreemy",
        "last_name":"Althold",
        "email":"kreemyalt@example.com",
        "password":"#123456@",
        "address":"No. 12 Borno way Ebutte-Metta Lagos",
        "phone":"0807-8988-9355"
        }
    }
    ```

  at the project terminal, run `rails console`. At the `irb` prompt, edit the user role created in postman
  By default, the role for a new user is `normal` but to be able to check how other endpoints work, you will
  need a `super_admin` or `admin` user.
  At  rails console you can change the role like below:

  ```rb
    u = User.first
    u.update(role:'super_admin')
    u.save
  ```

  This will change the first users' role to super_admin, and with that you can perform other request
  as long as you are the `super_admin` or `admin users`. Note that only user with super_admin role can
  create other `normal` users and also change role of other users.

        }
    }
